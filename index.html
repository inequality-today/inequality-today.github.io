            [HOST] – This is Inequality Today!, your podcast on NPR. Today, we
            host SARAH DINSMORE, a college student studying economics, and her
            grandfather, IAN DINSMORE, to talk about inequality today and in the
            past. Was income and wealth inequality always this bad? Let’s find
            out!
          </p>

          <p>
            [HOST] – Let’s first discuss everyone’s favorite topic: taxes! In
            what ways have tax policies evolved in the past 80 years?
          </p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – Ugh, taxes. Well, back in my day, there was barely
            any government interference. The government didn’t tell us what to
            do with our money, like they do now. When I worked for Ford in the
            50s, I worked everyday, 8 hours a day, and at the end of the week
            when I took home my paycheck I got to choose how I spent my money.
            Now it feels like those corrupt politicians in Washington try to
            take nearly half our paycheck in taxes!
          </p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – I understand your point, grandpa, but the 50s
            were actually more progressive than you may think. The government
            today is actually a lot more hands-off than it was 70 years ago.
            Specifically, redistributive policies have gotten less and less
            progressive in modern day. Because top income shares are increasing,
            we should expect taxes to be higher with top income percentiles.
          </p>

          <p>[IAN DINSMORE] – Hmm...I’m not so sure Sarah.</p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – Well you see, the exact opposite has actually
            been happening. The top federal tax rate has been sliced in half
            since the 50’s.
          </p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – What do you mean that top income shares are
            increasing? We had our share of millionaires and even billionaires
            back when I was young, too. You should go home and ask your parents
            about J. Paul Getty and Howard Hughes. Boy, did those men have some
            money!
          </p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – Well, from 2013 to 2018, the number of tech
            billionaires in the world alone has shot up from 76 to 148. Since
            when you were young, the 1% have gone from earning 10% of the total
            income in the nation to 20%.
          </p>

          <p>[IAN DINSMORE] – Well, I'll be!</p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – At the same time, there’s been a consolidation of
            most of America’s industries into monopolies. One way we know this
            is because in the past 40 years, these monopolies have caused
            products to have price markups that are three times as much as they
            used to be.
          </p>

          <p>
            [HOST] – Great, thank you both for sharing your experiences. Now
            onto quite a controversial topic these days: the minimum wage. What
            have each of your experiences been with minimum wage jobs?
          </p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – I can speak about this! By the time I started
            working at age 15 there was already a federal minimum wage. I
            believe at that time it was around a dollar an hour?
          </p>

          <p>[SARAH DINSMORE] – Wow, that’s crazy low!</p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – Well Sarah, as you know, everything was cheaper
            back then. Of course Mr. Ford often paid us even higher wages than
            he was required to. By the 1960s, I was making around $2.75. I mean
            you know, when I think about how much minimum wage workers make
            today, it's crazy! I was able to support your grandmother and your
            mother and aunts and uncles just fine on my salary. I mean, we
            weren't Rockefellers or anything, but we didn’t worry about not
            having enough food for the kids. How come minimum wage workers are
            always complaining about wages not being high enough when they're
            nearly 3 times as much as I made?
          </p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – I see, I think I understand what you're saying.
          </p>

          <p>[IAN DINSMORE] – Sarah, honey, it just doesn't make sense!</p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – Grandpa, it's actually very interesting that you
            ask this question. Because the reason wage inequality is such an
            issue currently is because while the nominal minimum wage has risen
            since the minimum wage was first put into place, the real minimum
            wage has significantly decreased since the 50s and 60s when you were
            working for Ford.
          </p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – Real minimum wage? What is this real minimum wage,
            and how is it different from the nominal minimum wage?
          </p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – It's very confusing, I know. The real minimum
            wage is adjusted for price changes over time. In other words it
            accounts for how much things cost in an economy and is able to give
            a better metric for how much a worker can do with the wage they are
            paid. The nominal minimum wage, by contrast, is simply the dollar
            wage that workers are paid, so when you were working for Ford it was
            around $2.75 as you said. The real minimum wage at this same time
            while you were working was around $9. Today, when I make minimum
            wage in my job on campus, at school, I make a real minimum wage of
            around $7, which as you can see is actually a decrease.
          </p>

          <p>
            [HOST] – Very interesting. So what does this all mean for the
            economy?
          </p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – This is part of a broader trend of the real
            minimum wage decreasing over time. It dropped drastically from
            almost $12 in 1980 to $7 by 1990. Since then, it’s hovered around
            $7, dipping below and rising slightly in the last 3 decades. I know
            that was probably confusing, all that, Grandpa, but in short, you
            can buy less with the minimum wage now than you used to be able to
            with the old minimum wage.
          </p>

          <p>[IAN DINSMORE] – Mm, I see.</p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – This is a very important part of the discussion
            surrounding minimum wage that I think people, especially those who
            are against raising the minimum wage, forget to discuss. In short,
            raising the minimum wage currently in the US would merely be
            reinstating the real wage rate you made when you worked, Grandpa.
          </p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – I think I understand what you’re saying about the
            minimum wage and why the real minimum wage is lower, but why has the
            real minimum wage decreased over time?
          </p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – Well, one of the key reasons is that there’s less
            union power today than there was in the 1940s to 1980s. There’s a
            strong correlation, in fact, between lower union density and
            stagnant wages for low-skilled workers, as well as between lower
            union density and a greater top 10% income share overall.
          </p>

          <p>[IAN DINSMORE] – Oh, that makes sense!</p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – And since the 1980s, there’s been a steady
            decline in union power, and only 10.8% of the American population is
            in a union today. In comparison, in 1980, 45% of the American
            population was in a union.
          </p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – Ah, I was once part of the Ford labor union. Thanks
            to the Roosevelt Administration, I was able to achieve a better
            wage, more reasonable hours, and safer working conditions overall. I
            actually got to give back money to my mom and pops once in a while
            too.
          </p>

          <p>[SARAH DINSMORE] – Wow! That must have been so nice.</p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – Yeah, definitely. Also, this one time, I sprained
            my ankle during the job, and unions pushed Ford to provide aid and
            cover the medical costs. It really took the pressure off my back - I
            mean, what would I have done without the extra help? Unfortunately,
            it seems as though things have really changed for you young people.
          </p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – Yeah Grandpa, that's true. Things are a lot worse
            than they used to be, in many ways. Unfortunately, many American
            workers don’t have much of a choice on how much they earn and where
            they work. We can see this all in the statistics. As the top 1% has
            doubled their slice of the income pie, the bottom 50% of Americans
            have had their share nearly halved.
          </p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – Wow Sarah, you've really learned a lot at school!
          </p>

          <p>
            [SARAH DINSMORE] – Yeah. The number of billionaires and monopolies
            in the world has increased, and the minimum wage worker is worse off
            than they used to be, even only a few decades ago. And on top of
            that, the government’s been taxing the rich less and less over the
            years.
          </p>

          <p>
            [IAN DINSMORE] – Wow. You know, I don't normally say this, but I
            understand why there’s been such a push for progressive policies!
            More people need to recognize how economically progressive America
            used to be. Thank you Sarah for helping me remember that. You’re so
            wise for your age!
          </p>

          <p>
            [HOST] – Okay folks. Unfortunately, that’s all the time we have for
            today. Thank you both for being here! I’m sure our audience learned
            a ton, I know I did.
